SwiftHub is an iOS app that displays Swift repositories from Github.

## Overview

SwiftHub displays Swift repositories on Github sorted by each repository's number of stars. SwiftHub can filter on repositories created in the last week, month, or year. Github's 'trending' list is not available through the Github API. SwiftHub demonstrates basic HTTP requests, protocol-oriented data flow, data modeling, a cache layer made with NSCache, and views made in code with AutoLayout.
